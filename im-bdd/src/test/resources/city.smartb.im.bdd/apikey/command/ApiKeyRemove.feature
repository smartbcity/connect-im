  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as admin
    And An organization is created:

    And Some roles are defined:
      | identifier | permissions     | targets |
      | r_writer   | im_apikey_write | USER    |
      | r_reader   | im_apikey_read  | USER    |
    And An API key is created

      | fake       |
    Then An exception should be thrown:
